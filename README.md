## Problem Statement
### McDonald's offer three sandwiches:

1. __A cheeseburger__<br />

    * BEEF PATTY
    * PASTEURIZED PROCESS AMERICAN CHEESE (CHEESE)
    * BEEF PATTY
    * PASTEURIZED PROCESS AMERICAN CHEESE (CHEESE)

    * UPPER ARTISAN ROLL (BREAD)

### Also, There are 3 type of Meals:
1. Sandwich only
2. Sandwich and fries
3. Sandwich, fries, and Soda


* You should implement a Meal maker where the user only defines the type of meal and the type of sandwich in the main function.
* You should use one (or more) design pattern(s) that you find suitable in your code.
* Your code should thoroughly follow the OOP Design concepts. [For example, notice that different types of cheese should inherit from the same parent]

### Bon Appetit!
